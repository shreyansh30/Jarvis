# Jarvis - Your Personal Assistant 🤖

Jarvis is a voice-activated artificial intelligence assistant, inspired by Cortana and Iron Man's JARVIS. It can perform various tasks through voice commands and help you with your daily activities.

## ✨ Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Understands and processes voice commands using advanced speech recognition
- **Text-to-Speech**: Responds to you with natural-sounding voice output
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Fetches information from Wikipedia on any topic
- **WolframAlpha Integration**: Performs complex calculations and answers computational queries
- **Interactive Conversations**: Engages in dynamic conversations and responds to various commands
- **Hands-Free Operation**: Complete voice-controlled interface for seamless interaction

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **pyttsx3**: Text-to-speech conversion
- **SpeechRecognition**: Voice command recognition
- **Wikipedia API**: Information retrieval
- **WolframAlpha API**: Computational intelligence
- **PyAudio**: Audio input/output handling

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Microphone for voice input
- Internet connection for API calls

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyansh30/Jarvis.git
   cd Jarvis
   ```

2. **Install required modules**
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3
   pip install wolframalpha
   pip install wikipedia
   pip install speechrecognition
   pip install pyaudio
   ```

   Or install all dependencies at once:
   ```bash
   pip install pyttsx3 wolframalpha wikipedia speechrecognition pyaudio
   ```

## 🎯 Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run the main Python file:
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```
   *(Note: Replace `jarvis.py` with your main file name if different)*

3. Speak your commands clearly into the microphone
4. Wait for Jarvis to process and respond

## 💡 Example Commands

- "Search Wikipedia for [topic]"
- "Calculate [mathematical expression]"
- "What is [question]?"
- And many more! 

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **Microphone not working**: Ensure your microphone is properly connected and configured
- **PyAudio installation issues**: 
  - On Windows: You may need to install PyAudio from a wheel file
  - On Linux:  Install PortAudio first using `sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev`
  - On Mac: Install PortAudio using `brew install portaudio`
